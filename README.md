## Getting Started

This project is a Clone of this webpage.
We have a cloned webpage built with following features:

1. Map the elements of the Smashing homepage and how they are grouped together
2. Copy the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and positioned
3. Change around the font styles and weights
4. Load in a few web fonts
5. A font/weight combination that approximates that of the original Smashing homepage and apply it to our solution

To get a local copy  and to set it up and running follow these simple example steps.
